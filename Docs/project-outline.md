<!-- This is a working doc where we can make lists of things to do and check them off -->

## TODO:
1. Write questions and answers
2. Come up with a score system. Maybe happiness out of 100 and a money amount?
3. Design the welcome and finish UI
4. Design logo and define colors, fonts, font size, etc...
5. Design db schema. Maybe we ask the user for a name when they play, then use that as an ID for leaderboard?


Our game is a text-based life simulation where players navigate various life decisions through a series of 20 choices presented in a card format. Players will progress through different scenarios, making choices that impact their virtual character's life outcomes. There is only one path through the game (it does not branch), but each answer has different statistics associated with it. At the end of the game, all the statistics will be combines to show the play how they did. This score will also be entered in a leader board of players.
